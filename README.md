# Digital Asset Repository

## ! Work in Progress !

This repository framework is optimized for Creative Common licensed content.

It was inspired by the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org) and other efforts to implement a global repository to enhance literacy of children in Africa and elsewhere.

Backend and frontend of this project are described in detail in two books:
- [Erlang and Elixir for Imperative Programmers](https://leanpub.com/erlangandelixirforimperativeprogrammers)
- [Web Applications with Elm](https://leanpub.com/webapplicationswithelm)
